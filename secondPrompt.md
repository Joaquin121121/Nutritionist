❯ Add fitness tracking, for each week day to have to be weightlifting,  
 and/or basketball pickup (at least one per week day, though I  
 should also be able to fill in non week days) . Physical training  
 should be part of the track and the progress tab. A third kind of  
 activity should have a tab of its own, called basketball. Completing  
 it should also account for a physical activity (should continue  
 streaks, be marked as physical activity). The tab should be composed  
 of the different shots I will be taking as part of my training  
 schedule. Each type of shot should be fillable via slider for good  
 UX, and a complete session button at the bottom of the sliders.  
 Completing the session should account for a physical activity  
 completed, which should be reflected on both track and progress  
 tabs.  
 Shots to be taken and tracked are the following. X Accounts for  
 number of shots made (to be filled by me), Y accounts to shots taken  
 (hardcoded)

Form Shots x25  
 Midrange C&S x25  
 Midrange Pullup x15  
 Triple C&S x50  
 Triple C&S x50  
 Flotadora x50 release saltando un tiempo  
 Bandejas gancho con izquierda en movimiento x25  
 Bandejas gancho con derecha en movimiento x25  
 Triples C&S x50  
 Libres x50

After completing a session, a session score should be displyaed according to the level of shooting. If there are no data ffor some fields, just ignore them, dont make them bring down the average

A fifth tab should show only basketball related stats, including  
 Best score
Avg weekly score with %improvement from last week
Avg monthly score with %improvement from last month
strongest to weakest shots by shot %, shots with most average  
 progress, shots with least avg progress.
