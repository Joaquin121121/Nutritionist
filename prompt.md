sIz want to build an app to keep track of my groceries as I eat different, meal prep meals, to know what to buy and what not to  
 (yet) The app is to be a mobile-first, nexjs, tsx, tailwindcss, vercel hosted app with a supabase db. Requirements:

1. It must allow me to choose between different meal options, in order to get their ingredients added into the shopping list
2. It must allow me to track which of those meals Im eating throughout the week, and must support cheat meals (to be
   personalized by me, not to be any of the meals I had planned for). It must show remaining meals, and have a section where I can  
   neatly see a calendar off my meals thorughout the week and the month and the year, and % of good (non-cheat) meals in the week,  
   month and year

The default meal plan, which I can choose to follow or should have the option to replace with other meals (wont be implemented  
 for now, will in the futue), will include (for the week):

Variable (I will have any of these per day, twice)
chicken with mashed pumpkin 4x
chicken with pasta and broccoli and cheese 2x
chicken with pasta and spinach and cheese 2x
rice with tuna and boiled eggs and carrots 2x
beef with rice, legumes and carrots and soy sauce 2xchicken with mashed pumpkin 4x
chicken with pasta and broccoli and cheese 2x
chicken with pasta and spinach and cheese 2x
rice with tuna and boiled eggs and carrots 2x
beef with rice, legumes and carrots and soy sauce 2x

Fixed (Daily, always):
a shake
a banana
an apple
greek yogurt with strawberries
3 scrambled eggs on toast

Groceries for this meal plan are to be:
Pechuga de Pollo Deshuesada: 2kg
Macarrones: un paquete de 500g
Broccoli: 500g
Espinaca: 500g
Queso rallado
Atun 500g
Zanahorias 1kg
Arroz 1kg
Bife 500/600g colita de cuadril
Lentejas un paquete
Yogur griego 7
Frutilla (600g / 20)
Bananas (8, no comprar mas que eso)
Manzanas 4
Salsa de soja
Avena
Cacao
Pasta de Mani
Leche
Creatina
24 huevos
Un pan grande o dos chicos
Barras Zafran
Queso cremoso

The app should have three tabs:
Track tab, to track what I ate throughout the day. It should allow for easy navigating back and forth to today and previous days, in case I forgot to log something. Its options should be two of any of the variable meals, and all of the fixed meals. All meals should have an emoji that represents them
Progress tab, to see the weekly, monthly and yearly summaries and % of non-cheat meals
Groceries tab, to generate grocieries for the week. Each item should be checkable by itself, and a new grociery list should be made available to reset the grocery list entirely

UX is to be clean, smooth, gamified, non ai looking
